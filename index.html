      <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>

      <div class="card">
        <p>
          When I began the Computer Science program, I was interested in technology in a general sense.
          Over time, that interest became more focused. Through coursework and the process of building
          this ePortfolio, I realized that I am most interested in infrastructure and enterprise-level
          systems, especially in structured environments such as state or public sector organizations.
          I am drawn to systems that need to be reliable, secure, and carefully designed rather than built
          quickly and revised later.
        </p>

        <p>
          Throughout the program, I developed the ability to think about computing systems beyond just
          whether they function. In projects involving databases, service layers, and full-stack development,
          I learned to evaluate structure, maintainability, and long-term impact. In CS 499, enhancing previous
          artifacts required me to step back and analyze my own design decisions. I identified areas where
          modularity could be improved, where efficiency could be refined, and where documentation could better
          support collaboration. This process reflects the program outcome of designing and evaluating computing
          solutions while managing trade-offs in structure and performance.
        </p>

        <p>
          Communication has also been an important area of growth. In discussion assignments and the informal code
          review video, I practiced explaining technical concepts in a way that made sense to different audiences.
          Whether discussing neural networks, reinforcement learning, or bias in AI systems, I focused on clarity
          and context rather than assuming technical knowledge. In professional environments, especially in enterprise
          or public systems, the ability to communicate clearly with managers, stakeholders, and team members is essential.
          The code review process in particular helped me strengthen my ability to justify design decisions and explain
          planned enhancements logically and professionally.
        </p>

        <p>
          My understanding of algorithms and data structures deepened as I examined efficiency, state-based models,
          and optimization strategies. In reinforcement learning discussions, I analyzed how systems make decisions based
          on states and rewards. In later modules, I evaluated how AI systems like AlphaGo Zero improved performance through
          structured iteration and self-play. These experiences reinforced the importance of efficiency, scalability, and
          careful evaluation of algorithmic design choices. Rather than seeing algorithms as abstract theory, I began viewing
          them as practical tools that shape how systems behave under real constraints.
        </p>

        <p>
          Security and accountability have become central to how I think about computing. In discussions about AI bias,
          privacy regulations, and responsible research, I consistently questioned how systems affect users. I learned that
          building software is not only about solving technical problems but also about anticipating unintended consequences.
          This mindset carries into database design, input validation, and system architecture. Protecting data, minimizing
          unnecessary exposure, and planning for future risks are especially important in enterprise and public-sector systems,
          where trust and compliance matter.
        </p>

        <p>
          The artifacts in this portfolio reflect that progression. The software design and engineering enhancement demonstrates
          improved modularity and structure. The algorithms and data structures enhancement focuses on computational reasoning
          and efficiency. The database enhancement highlights structured data management and system integration. Together, these
          artifacts show growth not only in technical implementation but also in design evaluation, communication, and security awareness.
        </p>

        <p>
          Completing the Computer Science program has shaped both my technical skill set and my professional goals.
          I am interested in contributing to infrastructure and enterprise systems that require stability, careful planning,
          and long-term accountability. I value environments where systems must work reliably, where decisions are documented,
          and where security and privacy are treated as foundational rather than optional.
        </p>

        <p>
          This ePortfolio represents how I approach computing problems: analytically, thoughtfully, and with attention to long-term impact.
          It reflects both what I have built and how I have learned to think as a computer science professional.
        </p>

        <p>
          This portfolio demonstrates my achievement of the program learning outcomes. Through code reviews and structured enhancements,
          I practiced building collaborative environments and supporting stakeholder decision making. By presenting artifacts, narratives,
          and visual demonstrations, I strengthened my professional written and oral communication skills. My enhancements required designing
          and evaluating computing solutions using algorithmic principles while managing design trade-offs in performance and structure.
          I applied industry-relevant tools and techniques, including full-stack development, database integration, and modular architecture.
          Finally, I developed a stronger security mindset by emphasizing data validation, privacy considerations, and responsible system design
          throughout my projects.

    <!-- ARTIFACT 2 -->
    <section class="section" id="artifact-2">
      <h2>Artifact 2: Algorithms and Data Structures</h2>

      <div class="card">
        <p>
          The artifact selected for this enhancement is a MongoDB-based dashboard application originally created during my CS 340 coursework.
          The project uses a MongoDB database containing animal shelter outcome data and a Python-based application layer to query and display
          filtered results. The artifact was originally developed to demonstrate basic CRUD functionality and database interaction. For this
          milestone, the artifact was enhanced to focus specifically on query execution behavior, algorithmic efficiency, and the impact of data
          structures such as indexes on performance.
        </p>

        <p>
          I selected this artifact for my ePortfolio because it provides a clear and practical demonstration of algorithmic principles applied
          in a real-world database context. While the application itself is relatively simple, the underlying query behavior highlights important
          concepts related to algorithms and data structures, including linear search, indexing, and performance trade-offs.
        </p>

        <p>
          The enhancement focused on analyzing how MongoDB executes queries when an index is not present. Using MongoDB Compass, I executed a
          filtered query on the <code>animal_type</code> field and examined the resulting execution plan. The explain plan showed a collection scan
          (COLLSCAN), meaning every document in the collection was examined to locate matching results. This behavior directly reflects a linear
          search algorithm, where time complexity increases proportionally with dataset size.
        </p>

        <p>
          This artifact showcases my ability to analyze algorithmic efficiency, interpret execution metrics, and evaluate how data structures such
          as indexes can significantly improve performance. By identifying the absence of an index and observing its effect on query execution,
          the artifact was improved from a basic database interaction into a meaningful demonstration of algorithm and data structure concepts.
        </p>

        <p>
          Enhancing this artifact reinforced the connection between theoretical algorithm concepts and practical implementation. Reviewing the explain
          plan made it clear that fundamental principles such as linear search and indexing still apply, even when a database abstracts the low-level
          mechanics. One challenge during this process was configuring the local MongoDB environment correctly, particularly managing authentication
          and service settings. Troubleshooting these issues strengthened my understanding of system configuration and tool usage.
        </p>

        <div class="summary">
          <h3>Narrative Summary</h3>
          <p>
            This enhancement demonstrates how algorithmic behavior shows up in real database queries. By reviewing MongoDB execution output, I was able
            to connect a collection scan (COLLSCAN) to a linear search pattern, then show how indexes function as a data structure that improves performance.
            The key learning was seeing how time and resource usage scale when queries cannot use an index.

            <p>
              Enhancing this artifact reinforced how database-level design decisions impact application performance and usability. Implementing projections
              and limits highlighted the importance of retrieving only the data an application needs. A major challenge was diagnosing and resolving
              authentication and connection issues, which strengthened my understanding of MongoDB security configuration and the value of validating
              connectivity early in the application lifecycle.
