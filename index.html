  <h2>Computer Science ePortfolio</h2>

  <p>
    This ePortfolio showcases selected artifacts from my coursework in the
    Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University. It highlights
    my growth across software engineering, algorithms and data structures,
    databases, and secure application development.

  <h3>Informal Code Review</h3>

  <p>
    The following informal code review examines an existing software artifact
    created earlier in the program. The review discusses the current functionality
    of the code, identifies areas for improvement, and outlines planned
    enhancements aligned with CS 499 course outcomes.
