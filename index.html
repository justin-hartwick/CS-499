    <p class="small">
      This ePortfolio showcases selected artifacts from my coursework in the Computer Science program at
      Southern New Hampshire University. It highlights my growth across software engineering, algorithms and
      data structures, databases, and secure application development.

    <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>

    <div class="card">
      <p>
        When I began the Computer Science program, I was interested in technology in a general sense.
        Over time, that interest became more focused. Through coursework and the process of building
        this ePortfolio, I realized that I am most interested in infrastructure and enterprise-level
        systems, especially in structured environments such as state or public sector organizations.
        I am drawn to systems that need to be reliable, secure, and carefully designed rather than built
        quickly and revised later.
      </p>

      <p>
        Throughout the program, I developed the ability to think about computing systems beyond just
        whether they function. In projects involving databases, service layers, and full-stack development,
        I learned to evaluate structure, maintainability, and long-term impact. In CS 499, enhancing previous
        artifacts required me to step back and analyze my own design decisions. I identified areas where
        modularity could be improved, where efficiency could be refined, and where documentation could better
        support collaboration. This process reflects the program outcome of designing and evaluating computing
        solutions while managing trade-offs in structure and performance.
      </p>

      <p>
        Communication has also been an important area of growth. In discussion assignments and the informal code
        review video, I practiced explaining technical concepts in a way that made sense to different audiences.
        Whether discussing neural networks, reinforcement learning, or bias in AI systems, I focused on clarity
        and context rather than assuming technical knowledge. In professional environments, especially in enterprise
        or public systems, the ability to communicate clearly with managers, stakeholders, and team members is essential.
        The code review process in particular helped me strengthen my ability to justify design decisions and explain
        planned enhancements logically and professionally.
      </p>

      <p>
        My understanding of algorithms and data structures deepened as I examined efficiency, state-based models,
        and optimization strategies. In reinforcement learning discussions, I analyzed how systems make decisions based
        on states and rewards. In later modules, I evaluated how AI systems like AlphaGo Zero improved performance through
        structured iteration and self-play. These experiences reinforced the importance of efficiency, scalability, and
        careful evaluation of algorithmic design choices. Rather than seeing algorithms as abstract theory, I began viewing
        them as practical tools that shape how systems behave under real constraints.
      </p>

      <p>
        Security and accountability have become central to how I think about computing. In discussions about AI bias,
        privacy regulations, and responsible research, I consistently questioned how systems affect users. I learned that
        building software is not only about solving technical problems but also about anticipating unintended consequences.
        This mindset carries into database design, input validation, and system architecture. Protecting data, minimizing
        unnecessary exposure, and planning for future risks are especially important in enterprise and public-sector systems,
        where trust and compliance matter.
      </p>

      <p>
        The artifacts in this portfolio reflect that progression. The software design and engineering enhancement demonstrates
        improved modularity and structure. The algorithms and data structures enhancement focuses on computational reasoning
        and efficiency. The database enhancement highlights structured data management and system integration. Together, these
        artifacts show growth not only in technical implementation but also in design evaluation, communication, and security awareness.
      </p>

      <p>
        Completing the Computer Science program has shaped both my technical skill set and my professional goals.
        I am interested in contributing to infrastructure and enterprise systems that require stability, careful planning,
        and long-term accountability. I value environments where systems must work reliably, where decisions are documented,
        and where security and privacy are treated as foundational rather than optional.
      </p>

      <p>
        This ePortfolio represents how I approach computing problems: analytically, thoughtfully, and with attention to long-term impact.
        It reflects both what I have built and how I have learned to think as a computer science professional.
      </p>

      <p>
        This portfolio demonstrates my achievement of the program learning outcomes. Through code reviews and structured enhancements,
        I practiced building collaborative environments and supporting stakeholder decision making. By presenting artifacts, narratives,
        and visual demonstrations, I strengthened my professional written and oral communication skills. My enhancements required designing
        and evaluating computing solutions using algorithmic principles while managing design trade-offs in performance and structure.
        I applied industry-relevant tools and techniques, including full-stack development, database integration, and modular architecture.
        Finally, I developed a stronger security mindset by emphasizing data validation, privacy considerations, and responsible system design
        throughout my projects.

    <h2>Artifact 1: Software Design and Engineering</h2>

    <div class="card">
      <p>
        This artifact is an Animal Shelter Dashboard originally created in CS 340. The application uses a MongoDB database
        containing animal shelter outcome data and a Python-based application layer to query and display filtered results.
        The original version focused on core CRUD behavior and correct client/server interaction with the database.
      </p>

      <p>
        I selected this artifact for my ePortfolio because it demonstrates my ability to design and structure a complete solution
        using modular components. For the software design and engineering enhancement, I focused on improving clarity and maintainability
        through modular organization, clearer separation of concerns, and improved documentation so the project is easier to understand
        and extend in a collaborative environment.

    <h2>Artifact 2: Algorithms and Data Structures</h2>

    <div class="card">
      <p>
        The artifact selected for this enhancement is a MongoDB-based dashboard application originally created during my CS 340 coursework.
        The project uses a MongoDB database containing animal shelter outcome data and a Python-based application layer to query and display
        filtered results. The artifact was originally developed to demonstrate basic CRUD functionality and database interaction. For this
        milestone, the artifact was enhanced to focus specifically on query execution behavior, algorithmic efficiency, and the impact of data
        structures such as indexes on performance.
      </p>

      <p>
        I selected this artifact for my ePortfolio because it provides a clear and practical demonstration of algorithmic principles applied
        in a real-world database context. While the application itself is relatively simple, the underlying query behavior highlights important
        concepts related to algorithms and data structures, including linear search, indexing, and performance trade-offs.
      </p>

      <p>
        The enhancement focused on analyzing how MongoDB executes queries when an index is not present. Using MongoDB Compass, I executed a
        filtered query on the <code>animal_type</code> field and examined the resulting execution plan. The explain plan showed a collection scan
        (COLLSCAN), meaning every document in the collection was examined to locate matching results. This behavior directly reflects a linear
        search algorithm, where time complexity increases proportionally with dataset size.
      </p>

      <p>
        This artifact showcases my ability to analyze algorithmic efficiency, interpret execution metrics, and evaluate how data structures such
        as indexes can significantly improve performance. By identifying the absence of an index and observing its effect on query execution,
        the artifact was improved from a basic database interaction into a meaningful demonstration of algorithm and data structure concepts.
      </p>

      <p>
        Enhancing this artifact reinforced the connection between theoretical algorithm concepts and practical implementation. Reviewing the explain
        plan made it clear that fundamental principles such as linear search and indexing still apply, even when a database abstracts the low-level
        mechanics. One challenge during this process was configuring the local MongoDB environment correctly, particularly managing authentication
        and service settings. Troubleshooting these issues strengthened my understanding of system configuration and tool usage.

  <section class="section" id="artifact-3">
    <h2>Artifact 3: Databases</h2>

    <div class="card">
      <p>
        The artifact selected for this enhancement is an Animal Shelter Dashboard originally created for CS 340. The original version demonstrated
        basic CRUD operations using MongoDB and displayed animal shelter data through a Python-based dashboard. For CS 499, this artifact was enhanced
        to better demonstrate database design principles, secure data access, and efficient data retrieval practices.
      </p>

      <p>
        The enhanced artifact consists of two primary components:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>MongoDB CRUD module</strong> (<code>CRUD_Python_Module.py</code>) that encapsulates database operations.</li>
        <li><strong>Dash-based interactive dashboard</strong> (Jupyter notebook) that retrieves, displays, and visualizes database records.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This artifact was selected for inclusion in my ePortfolio because it demonstrates my ability to design, implement, and enhance database-driven
        applications. It showcases practical database skills applicable to real-world development, including secure connections, structured data access,
        and performance-aware querying.

          <h3 style="margin-top: 0;">What I Learned</h3>
          <p>
            Enhancing this artifact reinforced how database-level design decisions impact application performance and usability. Implementing projections
            and limits highlighted the importance of retrieving only the data an application needs. A major challenge was diagnosing and resolving
            authentication and connection issues, which strengthened my understanding of MongoDB security configuration and the value of validating
            connectivity early in the application lifecycle.
