    <h2 class="muted">Computer Science ePortfolio (CS 499)</h2>

    <p class="small">
      This ePortfolio showcases selected artifacts from my coursework in the
      Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University. It highlights
      my growth across software engineering, algorithms and data structures,
      databases, and secure application development.

    <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>

    <div class="card">
      <p>
        When I began the Computer Science program, I was interested in technology in a general sense.
        Over time, that interest became more focused. Through coursework and the process of building
        this ePortfolio, I realized that I am most interested in infrastructure and enterprise-level
        systems, especially in structured environments such as state or public sector organizations.
        I am drawn to systems that need to be reliable, secure, and carefully designed rather than built
        quickly and revised later.
      </p>

      <p>
        Throughout the program, I developed the ability to think about computing systems beyond just
        whether they function. In projects involving databases, service layers, and full-stack development,
        I learned to evaluate structure, maintainability, and long-term impact. In CS 499, enhancing previous
        artifacts required me to step back and analyze my own design decisions. I identified areas where
        modularity could be improved, where efficiency could be refined, and where documentation could better
        support collaboration. This process reflects the program outcome of designing and evaluating computing
        solutions while managing trade-offs in structure and performance.
      </p>

      <p>
        Communication has also been an important area of growth. In discussion assignments and the informal code
        review video, I practiced explaining technical concepts in a way that made sense to different audiences.
        Whether discussing neural networks, reinforcement learning, or bias in AI systems, I focused on clarity
        and context rather than assuming technical knowledge. In professional environments, especially in enterprise
        or public systems, the ability to communicate clearly with managers, stakeholders, and team members is essential.
        The code review process in particular helped me strengthen my ability to justify design decisions and explain
        planned enhancements logically and professionally.
      </p>

      <p>
        My understanding of algorithms and data structures deepened as I examined efficiency, state-based models,
        and optimization strategies. In reinforcement learning discussions, I analyzed how systems make decisions based
        on states and rewards. In later modules, I evaluated how AI systems like AlphaGo Zero improved performance through
        structured iteration and self-play. These experiences reinforced the importance of efficiency, scalability, and
        careful evaluation of algorithmic design choices. Rather than seeing algorithms as abstract theory, I began viewing
        them as practical tools that shape how systems behave under real constraints.
      </p>

      <p>
        Security and accountability have become central to how I think about computing. In discussions about AI bias,
        privacy regulations, and responsible research, I consistently questioned how systems affect users. I learned that
        building software is not only about solving technical problems but also about anticipating unintended consequences.
        This mindset carries into database design, input validation, and system architecture. Protecting data, minimizing
        unnecessary exposure, and planning for future risks are especially important in enterprise and public-sector systems,
        where trust and compliance matter.
      </p>

      <p>
        The artifacts in this portfolio reflect that progression. The software design and engineering enhancement demonstrates
        improved modularity and structure. The algorithms and data structures enhancement focuses on computational reasoning
        and efficiency. The database enhancement highlights structured data management and system integration. Together, these
        artifacts show growth not only in technical implementation but also in design evaluation, communication, and security awareness.
      </p>

      <p>
        Completing the Computer Science program has shaped both my technical skill set and my professional goals.
        I am interested in contributing to infrastructure and enterprise systems that require stability, careful planning,
        and long-term accountability. I value environments where systems must work reliably, where decisions are documented,
        and where security and privacy are treated as foundational rather than optional.
      </p>

      <p>
        This ePortfolio represents how I approach computing problems: analytically, thoughtfully, and with attention to long-term impact.
        It reflects both what I have built and how I have learned to think as a computer science professional.
      </p>

      <p>
        This portfolio demonstrates my achievement of the program learning outcomes. Through code reviews and structured enhancements,
        I practiced building collaborative environments and supporting stakeholder decision making. By presenting artifacts, narratives,
        and visual demonstrations, I strengthened my professional written and oral communication skills. My enhancements required designing
        and evaluating computing solutions using algorithmic principles while managing design trade-offs in performance and structure.
        I applied industry-relevant tools and techniques, including full-stack development, database integration, and modular architecture.
        Finally, I developed a stronger security mindset by emphasizing data validation, privacy considerations, and responsible system design
        throughout my projects.

    <h2>Informal Code Review</h2>
    <p>
      The following informal code review examines an existing software artifact created earlier in the program.
      The review discusses the current functionality of the code, identifies areas for improvement, and outlines planned
      enhancements aligned with CS 499 course outcomes.

    <h2>Artifact 1: Software Design and Engineering</h2>

    <div class="card">
      <p>
        This artifact is based on a project originally created in CS 340: Advanced Programming Concepts.
        The application was designed to manage and query animal shelter data using a MongoDB backend and a Python-based
        service layer. The original version focused on core CRUD functionality and correct interaction with the database.
      </p>

      <p>
        I selected this artifact for my ePortfolio because it demonstrates my ability to design and structure a complete
        software solution using modular components. The enhancement for this category focused on improving the overall design,
        readability, and maintainability of the application. These changes included reorganizing functions for clearer separation
        of responsibilities, improving naming conventions, and adding structured documentation to better support future development
        and collaboration.
      </p>

      <p>
        Through this enhancement, I demonstrated software engineering skills such as modular design, abstraction, and code organization.
        I also applied principles of the software development lifecycle by evaluating the original design, identifying areas for improvement,
        and implementing changes that improve long-term usability without altering core functionality.
