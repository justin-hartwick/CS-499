  <h2>Computer Science ePortfolio</h2>

  <p>
    This ePortfolio showcases selected artifacts from my coursework in the
    Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University. It highlights
    my growth across software engineering, algorithms and data structures,
    databases, and secure application development.

  <h2>Professional Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    (This section will contain my professional self-assessment. It will introduce my
    professional goals, strengths, and how the artifacts below work together to
    demonstrate growth across the Computer Science program.)

  <h2>Informal Code Review</h2>
  <p>
    The following informal code review examines an existing software artifact
    created earlier in the program. The review discusses the current functionality
    of the code, identifies areas for improvement, and outlines planned
    enhancements aligned with CS 499 course outcomes.

  <h2>Artifact 1: Software Design and Engineering</h2>

  <p>
    This artifact is based on a project originally created in CS 340: Advanced Programming Concepts.
    The application was designed to manage and query animal shelter data using a MongoDB backend
    and a Python-based service layer. The original version focused on core CRUD functionality
    and correct interaction with the database.
  </p>

  <p>
    I selected this artifact for my ePortfolio because it demonstrates my ability to design
    and structure a complete software solution using modular components. The enhancement
    for this category focused on improving the overall design, readability, and maintainability
    of the application. These changes included reorganizing functions for clearer separation
    of responsibilities, improving naming conventions, and adding structured documentation
    to better support future development and collaboration.
  </p>

  <p>
    Through this enhancement, I demonstrated software engineering skills such as modular design,
    abstraction, and code organization. I also applied principles of the software development
    lifecycle by evaluating the original design, identifying areas for improvement, and
    implementing changes that improve long-term usability without altering core functionality.
    This artifact aligns with course outcomes related to professional software design,
    communication, and delivering maintainable computing solutions.
